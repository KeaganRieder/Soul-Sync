# Soul Synced

This is the compiled version of my game, Soul Sync. This game was made in a group for my game design class, where I took the role of lead programmer.
The game is a 2d split-screen coop platformer which has two players playing different characters that are designed to complement each other's weaknesses.

To play, just download the zip and run 'soul sync.exe'
